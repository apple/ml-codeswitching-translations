# German and Spanish Targets for Fisher and Miami Codeswitching Datasets

This dataset accompanies the research paper, `Towards Real-World Streaming Speech Translation for Code-Switched Speech`.

In the paper, we investigate translation of code-switched speech to a third language
(i.e., a language not included in the source).
To this end, we extend the Fisher and Miami test and validation datasets, which contain
English-Spanish codeswitched speech, to include new targets in monolingual Spanish and
German.

This dataset extends a codeswitching-focused dataset split accompanying an earlier paper,
[End-to-End Speech Translation for Code Switched Speech](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05076.pdf), 
which can be found [here](https://github.com/apple/ml-code-switched-speech-translation).

## Instructions:

- Please follow the instructions found [here](https://github.com/apple/ml-code-switched-speech-translation).
- The naming of the files in this dataset indicates which parallel data they belong to. Please note that a small portion of translations are marked as ``<removed>``, these should not be included in evaluation.
